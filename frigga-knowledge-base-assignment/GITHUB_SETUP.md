# Quick GitHub Setup Guide

Follow these simple steps to get your project on GitHub and share it with HR.

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub.com** and sign in
2. **Click "New" button** (green button on your repositories page)
3. **Fill in details**:
   - Repository name: `frigga-knowledge-base-assignment`
   - Description: `Confluence-like Knowledge Base - Frigga Assignment`
   - Make it **Public** (so HR can see it)
   - Don't initialize with README (we already have one)

## Step 2: Upload Your Code

### Option A: GitHub Desktop (Easiest)
1. **Download GitHub Desktop** from desktop.github.com
2. **Clone your new repository** to your computer
3. **Copy all project files** into the cloned folder
4. **Commit and push** using GitHub Desktop

### Option B: Replit Integration (Recommended)
1. **In Replit**, go to version control tab
2. **Connect to GitHub** and authorize
3. **Create new repository** with the same name
4. **Push your code** directly from Replit

## Step 3: Add Live Demo

### Deploy on Replit
1. **Keep your current Replit** running
2. **Copy the live URL** (shows in browser when app runs)
3. **Add it to your README** in the "Live Demo" section

## Step 4: Email to HR

Send this email to all three addresses:
- shafan@frigga.cloud
- veer@frigga.cloud  
- rakshitha@frigga.cloud

**Email Subject**: `Frigga Cloud Labs Assignment - [Your Name]`

**Email Body**:
